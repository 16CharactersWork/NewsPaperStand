Reading a newspaper made easy within the cli

Website being scaped [mgreader.com](mgreader.com)

I forked it, and making attempts 

Please check out [manga-cli](https://github.com/7USTIN/manga-cli/blob/master/README.md) as I got the inspiration from them. 

## Todo
1. Learn Bash!
2. See if I can scape websites
3. Try to understand this stuff

Goal is to right now print out a list from search, and be able to the link and have zanthare open it from a temp cache
